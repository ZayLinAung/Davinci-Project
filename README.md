Product Name: UNION

Product Summary:

Our project is called “UNION”. We have seen a problem of first-years struggling to meet up with their peers. Thus, to tackle this problem, we have created UNION, an app where university students can get matched with similar profiles based on their university, program, courses and interests. The front end of the web app is made on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Nicepages, while the back end is on Django and Python. This app can be used by many university students but mainly those who are incoming first-years or those who transferred from other universities. We hope UNION can make university communities more inclusive for all its students.
